# Phase 1 Audit Baseline Report

## Test Coverage Analysis Results

**Overall Coverage: 0.3%**

### Coverage Breakdown by Module:
- **components/scripts**: 0% coverage
  - analytics.js: 0% (205 lines uncovered)
  - main.js: 0% (1065 lines uncovered)
  - theme-toggle.js: 0% (148 lines uncovered)

- **scripts**: 0% coverage
  - dev-server.js: 0% (114 lines uncovered)
  - server.js: 0% (5 lines uncovered, but 100% function coverage)

- **scripts/utils**: 1.42% coverage
  - image-optimization.js: 5.88% (some coverage detected)
  - All other utility files: 0% coverage

- **src/components**: 0% coverage
  - qr-generator.js: 0% (160 lines uncovered)

### Critical Test Coverage Gaps Identified:

1. **Build System**: scripts/build.js not appearing in coverage (needs investigation)
2. **Core Components**: 0% coverage on main UI components
3. **Analytics System**: Complete gap in analytics tracking
4. **Theme System**: No coverage on theme switching functionality
5. **Image Optimization**: Minimal coverage on critical image processing
6. **QR Generation**: No coverage on QR code functionality

### Test Suite Status:
- **Total Tests Run**: Multiple test suites executed successfully
- **Failed Tests**: 2 failures detected
  - PDF timeout configuration test (expecting 30s, found 60ms)
  - Pre-commit configuration missing prettier

### Existing Test Strengths:
- Comprehensive PDF validation tests
- Pre-commit hook integration tests
- Build process validation tests
- Multi-version PDF generation tests

## Phase 1 Target Metrics:
- **Target Coverage**: 85% (from current 0.3%)
- **Coverage Gap**: 84.7% improvement needed
- **Priority Areas**: Build system, Core components, Utils

## Next Steps:
1. Investigate missing build.js from coverage collection
2. Add unit tests for critical utility functions
3. Create component-level tests for UI functionality
4. Fix identified test failures
5. Implement missing test infrastructure
