# CI Testing Documentation

This PR tests all CI workflows with the new directory structure to ensure:

1. **Conventional Commits Validation** - Works with new infrastructure/scripts path
2. **Build Process** - Functions with app/ source and workspace/ output
3. **Deployment Pipelines** - Handle new configuration paths  
4. **Code Quality** - Linting configs work from infrastructure/ci/
5. **Security Workflows** - All security scans and checks pass
6. **Performance Testing** - Lighthouse and performance tests work
7. **E2E Testing** - Playwright tests function with new structure

## Expected Results
All workflows should pass, demonstrating that the directory reorganization 
maintains full CI/CD functionality while providing better organization.
