## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Phase 2B-1: Critical Infrastructure Fixes**

#### **Sudo Command Resolution**
```dockerfile
# Before (FAILED - exit code 127)
RUN sudo apt-get install chromium  # ❌ sudo not available in node:22-slim

# After (SUCCESS - proper privilege escalation)
USER root                           # ✅ Switch to root for package installs
RUN apt-get install chromium       # ✅ Install as root user
USER appuser                       # ✅ Switch back to app user
```

#### **Playwright Module Access Fix**
```dockerfile
# Before (FAILED - module not found in smoke tests)
FROM golden-base AS test-base
COPY source code only              # ❌ Missing devDependencies

# After (SUCCESS - full dependency access)  
FROM golden-base AS test-base
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci && npm cache clean --force  # ✅ Install all dependencies including playwright
```

### **Phase 2B-2: Advanced Registry Caching**

#### **Dual-Layer Caching Architecture**
```yaml
cache-from: |
  # Registry cache (primary) - persistent across runners
  type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}-cache:golden-base
  type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}-cache:golden-base-${{ github.ref_name }}
  
  # GitHub Actions cache (fallback) - fast local cache
  type=gha,scope=golden-base-${{ github.ref_name }}
  type=gha,scope=golden-base-main

cache-to: |
  # Persist to both layers for maximum reliability
  type=registry,ref=ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}-cache:golden-base,mode=max
  type=gha,mode=max,scope=golden-base-${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### **Phase 2B-3: Parallel Execution Strategy**

#### **Cache Warming Implementation**
```yaml
warm-cache:
  name: Warm Cache
  timeout-minutes: 5
  steps:
    - name: Pre-warm golden-base cache
      run: |
        # Build base layers in parallel
        docker buildx build --target golden-base . &
        docker buildx build --target test-base . &
        wait  # Wait for parallel warming to complete
```

#### **Parallel Smoke Tests**
```yaml
- name: Run parallel smoke tests
  run: |
    # All basic tests run in parallel with background processes
    (docker run --rm $IMAGE_TAG echo "Container started") &
    (docker run --rm $IMAGE_TAG node --version) &
    (docker run --rm $IMAGE_TAG npx playwright --version) &
    (docker run --rm $IMAGE_TAG whoami && id) &
    
    wait  # Wait for all parallel tests
    echo "✅ Basic tests completed"
    
    # Browser test runs sequentially (resource-intensive)
    docker run --rm $IMAGE_TAG node -e "browser launch test..."
```
