# Test: Chrome Options Fix Verification

This PR tests that the Chrome options fix in shared-comprehensive-testing.yml correctly detects accessibility violations.

## Background

Previously, shared comprehensive testing was reporting 0 accessibility violations instead of 83 due to missing Chrome options in axe commands.

## Fix Applied

Added Chrome options to both axe commands in shared-comprehensive-testing.yml:
- Line 305: `--chrome-options="--no-sandbox,--disable-setuid-sandbox,--disable-dev-shm-usage,--disable-extensions,--disable-gpu,--headless=new"`
- Line 320: Same Chrome options for consistency

## Expected Results

- Shared comprehensive testing should now detect ~83 accessibility violations
- PR comments should show realistic violation counts instead of false "EXCELLENT! ðŸŽ‰"
- Both individual and shared accessibility tests should report consistent results
# Test improvements
