# üéØ NETLIFY CONFIGURATION - OPTIMIZED FOR BUILD MINUTES CONSERVATION
#
# Strategy:
# - üöÄ GitHub Pages: Production builds (unlimited)
# - üì± Netlify: PR previews only (conserves 300 build minutes/month)
# - üéØ Benefits: Cost-effective, reliable, consistent artifacts
#
# Build Allocation:
# - Production (main): GitHub Pages ‚úÖ
# - PR Previews: Netlify ‚úÖ
# - Branch Deploys: DISABLED (saves minutes) ‚ùå
# - Random Pushes: DISABLED (saves minutes) ‚ùå
