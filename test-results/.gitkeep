# This directory contains test artifacts and reports
#
# Files in this directory are created by:
# - Playwright E2E tests (HTML reports, screenshots, traces)
# - Jest unit tests (coverage reports)  
# - Visual regression testing (baseline screenshots)
# - Performance testing (lighthouse reports)
#
# This .gitkeep ensures the directory structure is preserved
# in version control while the actual test artifacts are ignored
