## üîê Security Measures

This project implements comprehensive security practices:

### Automated Security Scanning
- **Daily Vulnerability Scans**: OSV Scanner, Trivy, Checkov
- **Secret Detection**: TruffleHog scanner for leaked credentials
- **Dependency Auditing**: NPM audit with security fix automation
- **Container Security**: Multi-layer Docker image scanning

### Code Security
- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL security scanning
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Checkov policy validation
- **GitHub Actions**: Secure workflow configurations with least privilege
- **Supply Chain**: Pinned action versions with Dependabot monitoring

### Development Security
- **Conventional Commits**: Enforced for audit trail
- **Branch Protection**: Required reviews and status checks
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Local security validations
- **Release Automation**: Secure release-please workflow

### Infrastructure Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All connections encrypted in transit
- **Secure Headers**: CSP, HSTS, and security headers configured
- **Docker Hardening**: Non-root user, minimal attack surface
- **Network Security**: Principle of least privilege networking

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### Build Dependencies
- Node.js and NPM dependencies are regularly audited
- Docker base images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- GitHub Actions use pinned versions for supply chain security

### Data Privacy
- No personal data is stored or transmitted
- Resume data is statically generated at build time
- No runtime data collection or analytics tracking

### Deployment Security
- Static site deployment reduces attack surface
- No server-side code execution or dynamic content
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) provides DDoS protection

## üîß Security Configuration

### For Contributors

1. **Enable 2FA**: Required for all repository contributors
2. **Use Signed Commits**: GPG signing recommended for authenticity
3. **Follow Security Guidelines**: Adhere to secure coding practices
4. **Report Issues**: Use security issue template for vulnerabilities

### For Deployers

1. **Secure Secrets**: Use proper secret management for deployment credentials
2. **Network Security**: Configure appropriate firewall and access controls
3. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for deployed instances
4. **Updates**: Keep deployment infrastructure updated with security patches
